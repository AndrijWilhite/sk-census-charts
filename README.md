## Getting Started

Hello! Welcome to the Census Charts assignment. You're about to take a tour through a semi completed Angular project that needs your help to finish.

The project structure has been setup according to best practices, and all the boilerplate code has been written. Your task is to add the charts as shown in the example image.

All the steps are outlined starting in [./app/app.module.js](./app/app.module.js). Clone the project and open that file first in Atom.
